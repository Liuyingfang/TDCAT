# Codes for implementation of PDCAT 

Functions:
1. PDCAT.R: This file includes functions for implementing the proposed method PDCAT. 
2. Simulation and real data.R: This file includes functions for generating simulated data, comparison with alternatives, and real data analysis.

Data:
1. INCHINT.R: This file includes datas for GWAS summary data. 
2. gene_dict_INCHINT.R: This file includes a dictionary for matching gene and SNPs.
3. genotype_part1.R: This file includes the first part data coding of genotype of multiple SNPs within our concerning genes.
4. genotype_part2.R: This file includes the second part data coding of genotype of genotype of multiple SNPs within our concerning genes.
Our concerning genotype consists of genotype_part1 and genotype_part2.
